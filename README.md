  <Strong>Sepsis Analysis and Prediction Using FastAPI</strong>
</h1>

## Introduction

**APIs** work by sharing data between applications, systems, and devices. This happens through a request and response cycle. A user initiates a request for data by interacting with an application. The request is sent to the API, which retrieves the data and returns it to the user. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/)

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

The key features are:

***Fast:*** Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

***Fast to code:*** Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *

***Fewer bugs:*** Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *

***Intuitive:*** Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

***Easy:*** Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

***Short:*** Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

***Robust:*** Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

***Standards-based:*** Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, stands as a critical global health challenge, claiming countless lives annually. Its rapid progression and often elusive symptoms make early detection and intervention paramount. This introduction prepares us to carefully look into the dataset, forming the basis for the project goals. By closely examining the details of sepsis using data analysis, I aim to add to what I know, helping to create better and more focused ways to recognize and handle sepsis early. 

## Objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model for sepsis, utilizing advanced data analysis techniques to forecast the likelihood of an individual developing sepsis based on key indicators from available datasets. The significance of this predictive model lies in its potential to facilitate early detection, thereby improving patient outcomes, reducing mortality rates, and optimizing the allocation of medical resources and create an API that will requested to interact with a ML model.

This endeavor addresses the needs of various stakeholders, including healthcare providers who can benefit from improved early detection for prompt treatment, patients who may experience better outcomes with timely interventions, healthcare institutions that can optimize resource utilization, and researchers contributing to the growing body of knowledge in sepsis prediction. Additionally, public health organizations stand to gain insights for developing targeted strategies, potentially reducing the overall burden of sepsis on healthcare systems. 

APIs enable different software systems to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly. This promotes interoperability between applications, allowing them to work together and share data in a standardized manner.

APIs allow developers to create modular systems by breaking down complex applications into smaller, independent components. This modularity enhances scalability, as individual components can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.
